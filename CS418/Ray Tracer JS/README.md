Open index.html in your broswer. And click the render button to render the scene.
The image will show on the web page when the rendering is finished.
If you leave the full rendering unchecked, it will only render a few spheres and planes, which takes less than 5 minutes.
If you check it, it will generate a couple more random spheres, on average it takes about 1-1.5 hours to finish.
Creativity: The checkbord texture on the floor.
Bounding Volume Hierarchy: I feel I'm close to the implementation but I couldn't figure out how to sort the list using the comparator function correctly, so in the submiited version of this ray tracer BVH is not implemented.
